#SiteMapScreenShot.py

This script significantly reduces the effort in cross-browser testing large sites.

To use this script, you will need to have Selenium and PhantomJS installed. Then update the site_domain and xml_file_name values and run the script. The files will, by default, be saved in a "screenshots/" folder relative to the script.

Supplied drivers (all for 64bit Windows):
1. PhantomJS
2. Chrome
3. Firefox
4. Internet Explorer (you can set the browser mode and document mode after the script starts running)
